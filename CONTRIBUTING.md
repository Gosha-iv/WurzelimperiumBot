# How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**
- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/MasterZydra/WurzelimperiumBot/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
- Ask any question about how to use as [Issue](https://github.com/MasterZydra/WurzelimperiumBot/issues) with the label **question**.

#### **What is a pull request?**
A pull request, short PR, is the best way to get changes from a forked repository merged into the main repository.  
PRs have multiple advantages:
- The maintainers can review the changes and see what will change if it is accepted and merged.
- If the branch in the forked repository changed, the PR gets automatically updated with that new changes.
- When creating a PR or changes are pushed from the forked repository a check is executed if it can merge without conflicts.

#### **What is the process to get a pull request merged?**
- The maintainer(s) of the main repository have to review the PR.
- If changes are requested these have to be fixed, to ensure the quality and stability of the project.
- The changes must not break the functionality so that the main branch will be defective.
